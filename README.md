## Fullstack React Book Work

*This is my implementation of the time tracking app presented in the book Fullstack React.*

### Running the app

1. Ensure you have `npm` installed.

Follow the instructions for your platform [here](https://github.com/npm/npm).

2. Install all dependencies:

````
npm install
````

3. Boot the HTTP server

````
npm run server
````

The server is now running at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)
